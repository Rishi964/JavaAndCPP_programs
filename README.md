##Strict Guidelines for Acceptance of PR
1. Add enough comments in your code, so that the other users can understand the code.
2. Add Problem's question reference as a link or if possible write the question as a comment within the Code file.
3. If you can add multiple solution to same problem with different time complexity, please don't create another file rather put all in same file and state the complexity before writing next code block, as a comment.
